A collage type repo acting as a central hub for numerical methods and simulation sandboxes sites \
with focus on rich, modern web features including:
- Customizable setups and math equations using [CortexJS Mathlive](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/) and [Compute Engine](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine/)
- Efficient numerical computing with Python using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/)
- Demonstrations in 3D graphics with VR/AR compatibility using [A-frame](https://aframe.io/)

As of now it includes:
- A sandbox for visualizing system of differential equations in 3d VR space
- A sandbox for simulating quantum wave functions in 1 dimension
  - (Schrodinger's sandbox, external link to another repo)
- ...more to come!
